This is a data pack which configures Stand stats in Ripples of the Past mod.
To change the stats of a Stand using this data pack, you'll need to:
1) Find a .json file for a Stand you want to configure (inside data/jojo/stand_stats folder).
2) Open it with any text editor and change the values you need.
----
The file has two main blocks of variables:
	statsBase - stats the Stand will have at the start of its progression (Resolve levels, up to 4)
	statsDevPotential - stats by the end of the progression
		The stats progress towards the statsDevPotential values with each Resolve level.

Here is what each stat in these blocks affects:
	power - attacks damage and, to a lesser extent, damage resistance
	speed - attacks speed, movement speed and barrage hit count
	durability - stamina usage and damage resistance
	precision - hitbox detection, projectile accuracy and, to a lesser extent, barrage damage

Each Stand also has two range parameters, relevant for the manual control mode:
	rangeEffective - maximum range (in blocks) at which the Stand doesn't lose its strength
	rangeMax - the Stand cannot move beyond that range

Currently, The World and Star Platinum have additional settings which affect their time stop abilities:
	timeStopMaxTicks - maximum time stop duration limit you can go up to while not being a vampire 
	timeStopMaxTicksVampire - maximum time stop duration limit for vampires with >= 80% vampire energy
	timeStopLearningPerTick - how many ticks of maximum time stop you add to your time stop limit for each tick in time stop
		Example: if you only can stop time for 2 seconds, and this value is set to 0.5, after stopping time for 2 seconds your limit will increase by 2 * 0.5 = 1 second (going up to 3 seconds).
	timeStopDecayPerDay - time stop duration limit (in ticks) subtracted by the end of the day, if you haven't used a time stop ability that day at least once.
	timeStopCooldownPerTick - time stop ability cooldown multiplier
		Example: after stopping time for 5 seconds, if this value is set to 3.0, time stop will go on 15 seconds cooldown.

Important: if you remove a value from the file, it will be automatically set to 0 in game, so make sure the file has the same amount of lines as it had before.
However, if you do not want to change a certain Stand's stats, its whole file can be deleted.

3) Save the edited file(s).
4) Open the world, or type /reload command in the chat if you're editing it while playing in that world (basically the standard process of data pack loading).

This data pack's format will stay the same throughout v0.2.X versions of the mod, however, it may or may not change by the time v0.3 comes out.
